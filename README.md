### Project Structure
##### Scripts folder contains -
###### 1.1 HotelManagement(DDL) - Script to create database and tables for the associated entities
###### 1.2 HotelManagement(DML) - Script to populate the database with dummy data
###### 1.3 HotelManagement(Script Analysis) - Script containing Stored Procedures, Triggers, Non-clustered Index of the database


### Set up Instructions

###### 1. Database Setup: Install a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server on your local machine or server. Use the provided DDL (Data Definition Language) script to create the database schema, tables, constraints, and relationships. The script should be named something like HotelManagementSystem_DDL.sql. Execute the DDL script in your RDBMS environment to create the database and its associated structures.


###### 2. Data Population: Once the database schema is created, use the provided DML (Data Manipulation Language) scripts to populate the database with sample data. The script should be named something like HotelManagementSystem_DML.sql.Execute the DML script in your RDBMS environment to insert sample records into the tables, including data for rooms, guests, staff, reservations, invoices, payments, and any other relevant entities.
###### 3. Stored Procedures and Triggers:If the Hotel Management System includes stored procedures, triggers, or other database programmability objects, use the provided scripts to create them in your database. The script should be named something like HotelManagementSystem_Programmability.sql. Execute the programmability script in your RDBMS environment to create the stored procedures, triggers, and other objects required for system functionality.
